# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool (by Tarandeep Singh)

This is a beginner-friendly, interactive command-line tool that helps you **encrypt and decrypt messages** using the classic **Caesar Cipher** technique.

It's **not a GUI tool** or online encryption system — it runs in the terminal and helps you hide or reveal messages just like ancient Roman generals did 👑.

## 👨‍💻 How It Works

Written entirely in **Python**, this script lets users:
- 🔏 Encrypt a message by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
- 🔓 Decrypt a message by shifting letters backward using the same shift.
- 🧠 Understand Caesar Cipher by seeing it in action.

```python
def encrypt(text, shift): ...
